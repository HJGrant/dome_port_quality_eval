# Dome Port Image Quality Evaluation

Evaluate the effect of a dome port on image quality and investigate how SSIM changes based on changing parameters such as focus point and aperture. 

Using the POSER simulation environment for underwater photogrammetry, the Blender script allows to create a sequence of images with varying focus distances, while the dome port is placed on the camera. 
The evaluation code allows to compare the image sequence to a reference image with no dome port, and known focus distance set in POSE.
